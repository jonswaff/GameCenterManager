It makes it easy to report and keep track of high scores achievements, and challenges for different players. Game Center Manager also takes care of the heavy lifting - checking internet availability, saving data when offline and uploading it when online, etc.\r\n\r\n<img width=750 src=\"https://github.com/iRareMedia/GameCenterManager/blob/master/Interface.png?raw=true\"/>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Scores and achievements saved if no internet connection is available or an error occurred while reporting to Game Center. Scores and achievements are uploaded again when Game Center is available.\r\n- Synchronization of Game Center data on first run\r\n- Encryption of Game Center data\r\n- Simple methods for uploading and retrieveing data\r\n- Delegate methods\r\n- Easy to use and setup\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Add the `GameKit` and `SystemConfiguration` frameworks to your Xcode project  \r\n2. Add the following classes (can be found in the *GC Manager* folder) to your Xcode project (make sure to select Copy Items in the dialog):  \r\n   -  GameCenterManager  \r\n   -  Reachability \r\n   -  NSDataAES256  \r\n3. Open the `GameCenterManager.h` file and change the `kGameCenterManagerKey` constant to the secret key you want to use for encryption/decryption  \r\n4. Import the `GameCenterManager.h` file  \r\n5. Add the delegate `GameCenterManagerDelegate` to your header file, then set the delegate in your implementation and add any delegates you'd like to use (see **Delegates**):\r\n\r\n        [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] setDelegate:self];\r\n\r\nUsing the Demo App\r\n------------\r\n\r\nGame Center Manager's demo app makes it easier to test Game Center integration and how it works with Game Center Manager. It also lays out how to use the `GameCenterManager` class. To get the most out of the Game Center Manager demo app you'll need to connect it to your an app which you have setup in iTunes Connect. You can read about setting up and developing with Game Center from <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/GameKit_Guide/GameCenterOverview/GameCenterOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008304-CH5-SW7\">Apple's Developer Documentation</a> and you can also follow these steps to connect the GC Manager demo with your current app.\r\n\r\n  1. First, check and make sure your app is setup in **iTunes Connect** and that Game Center is enabled  \r\n  2. In the GC Manager Demo app, change the **Bundle ID** to the same ID of the app which is setup in iTunes Connect  \r\n  3. Go to the GC Manager Project Build Settings and change the **Code Signing Identity** to match the provisioning profile of your app  \r\n  4. Customize the achievement and scoreboard submission IDs in the ViewController.m to actual values from your app  \r\n  5. Run the GC Manager Demo in the Game Center Sandbox - if everything is properly setup and you're signed into the GC Sandbox then it should run properly and submit achievements and leaderboards.\r\n\r\nIf you find any issues with this process, please file an <a href=\"https://github.com/iRareMedia/GameCenterManager/issues/new\">issue</a> so we can fix it or update the instructions.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n-----\r\n\r\n###Initialize GameCenterManager\r\nYou should initialize GameCenterManager when your app is launched, preferably in the `application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method by calling\r\n\r\n    [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] initGameCenter];  \r\n\r\nThis checks if Game Center is supported in the current device, authenticates the player and synchronizes scores and achievements from Game Center if its being run for the first time.\r\n\r\n###Check Game Center Support\r\nCheck for Game Center availability:\r\n\r\n    [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] checkGameCenterAvailability];  \r\n\r\n\r\n###Report Score\r\nReport a score to Game Center:\r\n\r\n    [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] saveAndReportScore:1000 leaderboard:@\"Leaderboard Name\"];  \r\n\r\nThis method saves the score locally as well. If GameCenter is not available, the scores will be saved locally and uploaded to Game Center the next time your app or game can connect to Game Center.\r\n\r\n###Report Achievement\r\nReport an achievement to Game Center:\r\n\r\n    [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] saveAndReportAchievement:@\"1000Points\" percentComplete:50];  \r\n\r\nThis method saves the achievement progress locally as well. If GameCenter is not available, the achievement will be saved locally and uploaded to Game Center the next time your app or game can connect to Game Center.\r\n\r\n###Get High Scores\r\nGet the high scores for the current player:\r\n\r\n    //Array of leaderboard ID's to get high scores for\r\n    NSArray *leaderboardIDs = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"Leaderboard1\", @\"Leaderboard2\", nil];\r\n\r\n    //Returns a dictionary with leaderboard ID's as keys and high scores as values\r\n    [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] highScoreForLeaderboards:leaderboardIDs];  \r\n\r\n###Get Achievement Progress\r\nTo get achievement progress for the current player, you can call\r\n\r\n    //Array of achievement ID's to get progress for\r\n    NSArray *achievementIDs = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"Achievement1\", @\"Achievement2\", nil];\r\n\r\n    //Returns a dictionary with achievement ID's as keys and progress as values\r\n    [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] progressForAchievements:achievementIDs];  \r\n\r\n###Get Challenges\r\nTo get challenges for the current game and player, you can call\r\n\r\n    //Returns an array with challenges. If there is an error retrieving the challenges, an array containing the error is returned. Returns `nil` if it was unable to connect to GameCenter.\r\n    NSArray *challenges = [[GameCenterManager sharedManager] getChallenges]; \r\n\r\nDelegates\r\n-----\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr><th colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\">Required Delegate Methods</th></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Authenticate User</td>\r\n    <td> If the user is not logged into GameCenter, you'll need to present the GameCenter login view controller.
